# Example dataset: synthetic vector field #

This dataset is a synthetic vector field containing several different features (linear flow, source, sink, saddles, rotation and noise). The pre-processing utility was used to extend the vector field with several derivatives and to perform auto-scaling and PCA. Only the first four principal components were stored.
