# Example dataset: tapered cylinder #

This dataset was converted from the "Tapered Cylinder" dataset, publically available at http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Resources/datasets.html

Tapered Cylinder
D. Jespersen and C. Levit, 1991. Unsteady solution of viscous flow around a tapered cylinder. Re = 150, defined by cylinder radius at midspan. Vortex shedding at varying frequencies (related to varying cylinder radius) leads to vortex tearing events.

The dataset was resampled from its original 64 × 64 × 32 curvilinear grid to a regular grid of 128 × 128 × 204 points. The pre-processing utility was used to extend the vector field with several derivatives and to perform auto-scaling and PCA. Only the first four principal components were stored.
